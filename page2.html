<p>shayy academy , aka the sc stars , has a number of award-winning cheer divisions, both in the standard and coed tracks.

To help their team make it to nationals, the school's Pep and Cheer club holds an annual fundraiser. They made enough to take their star athletes all the way to Dallas, where they placed fourth alongside their rivals at Ravenwood High.
